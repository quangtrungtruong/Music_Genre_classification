Report: Music Genre Classification with Deep Learning

This code reproduces the work of Albert Jiménez, Ferran José "MUSIC GENRE RECOGNITION WITH DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS". But I have not trained with the GTZAN dataset and leave it in the future. The weights loaded are the only initial weights that were saved at the beginning. I will improve the RCNN network in the following versions.

Dataset:GTZAN dataset 
Currently, the genres supported are the GTZAN dataset tags: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, HipHop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock

Code: 
Technology: Python3 with Flask and tensorflow2, and MySQL.

Prerequisites:
- Have pip, virtualenv
- Install requirements.txt:
	# Create environment
	virtualenv env_mgc
	# Activate environment
	source env_song/bin/activate
	# Install dependencies
	pip install -r requirements.txt


How to run:
1. create db Music_Genre_classification with script Music_Genre_classification.sql
2. python run.py

Test the website: 
http://0.0.0.0:5001/[song_path]
Example: http://0.0.0.0:5001/metal.00001.wav
Currently, the system merely classified songs in the folder dataset/set
